           Iâ€™m <b>Shanawaj Nadaf</b>, a passionate and self-driven Computer Science Engineering student with a deep interest in <b>Frontend Development</b>. I specialize in building clean, responsive, and user-focused interfaces using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. With a strong eye for design and detail, I believe great UI/UX is not just about how it looks â€” itâ€™s about how it feels and functions for users.
          </p>

<p class="a1" style="animation-delay: 1.5s; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: x-large;" >
  Currently in my <b>5th semester</b>, Iâ€™ve already built several frontend projects that reflect real-world applications. Iâ€™m actively sharpening my JavaScript skills and exploring modern tools like <b>Git, GitHub, and VS Code</b> to stay ahead in my journey. I plan to dive into <b>React.js</b> soon to build scalable, component-based web apps.
</p>

<p class="a1" style="animation-delay: 3.5s; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: x-large;" >
  I strongly believe in consistency, discipline, and continuous learning. Every project I take on is an opportunity to grow, improve, and build something meaningful. I aim to become a highly skilled frontend engineer and secure a high-impact role in a top-tier company.
</p>

<p class="a1" style="animation-delay: 5.5s; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size:x-large;">
  My strengths lie in <b>problem-solving, clean code practices, attention to detail</b>, and understanding user needs. Whether Iâ€™m building from scratch or collaborating in a team, I bring energy, creativity, and a hunger to learn and adapt.
</p>
<p class="a1" style="animation-delay: 7.5s; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">
  ðŸš€ Always open to collaboration, internships, and projects. Letâ€™s build something amazing together.
